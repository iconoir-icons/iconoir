Iconoir is an open source library with 900+ SVG Icons. No premium icons, no email sign-up, no newsletters. You can browse the full suite of icons at [iconoir.com](https://iconoir.com/).

`iconoir-react-native` is an open source package that exports these icons as React Native components (`react-native-svg`) that can be used in all of your React Native projects.

## Installation

```
yarn add iconoir-react-native react-native-svg
```
or
```
npm i iconoir-react-native react-native-svg
```

## Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { Iconoir } from 'iconoir-react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Iconoir />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Icons can take any `react-native-svg` properties as optional props, e.g.
```javascript
<Iconoir color="red" height={36} width={36} />
```
Default values for the most common props are given below:

| Prop name   | Default value  |
|-------------|----------------|
| color       | "currentColor" |
| width       | "1.5em"        |
| height      | "1.5em"        |
| strokeWidth | 1.5            |
| fill        | "none"         |

## IconoirProvider

Tired of specifying the same props for every single icon, every time you use them? So were we. Use IconoirProvider to set the default icon props for everything inside IconoirProvider.

```tsx
import { IconoirProvider, Check } from 'iconoir-react-native'

return (
  <IconoirProvider
    iconProps={{
      color: '#AAAAAA',
      strokeWidth: 1,
      width: '1em',
      height: '1em',
    }}
  >
    <SomeOtherContainer>
      <Check />
    </SomeOtherContainer>
  </IconoirProvider>
)
```

## Icon names

For the most part, the React components are named as PascalCase variations of their reference names (i.e. `add-circle-outline` becomes `AddCircleOutline`). However, some names have been altered slightly either because they start with numerical digits, which would lead to invalid React component names, or because they are organisations which use PascalCase in their brand names, such as `GitHub`. The altered names are as follows:

| Iconoir Name     | React Native Component |
|------------------|------------------------|
| `1st-medal`      | `Medal1St`             |
| `4k-display`     | `Display4K`            |
| `4x4-cell`       | `Cell4X4`              |
| `360-view`       | `View360`              |
| `github`         | `GitHub`               |
| `github-outline` | `GitHubOutline`        |
| `gitlab-full`    | `GitLabFull`           |
| `linkedin`       | `LinkedIn`             |
| `tiktok`         | `TikTok`               |
| `youtube`        | `YouTube`              |
